‚ú® Your new, shiny [Nx workspace](https://nx.dev) is ready ‚ú®.

[Learn more about this workspace setup and its capabilities](https://nx.dev/nx-api/js?utm_source=nx_project&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=nx_projects) or run `npx nx graph` to visually explore what was created. Now, let's get you up to speed!

## üê≥ Docker Support

This project includes Docker support for containerized deployment with docker-compose.

### Prerequisites

- Docker (version 20.10 or higher)
- Docker Compose (version 2.0 or higher)

### Quick Start with Docker

1. **Build the applications** (required before Docker containerization):
   ```sh
   npm install
   npx nx run-many --target=build --all
   ```

2. **Build and start all services**:
   ```sh
   docker compose up --build
   ```

3. **Access the applications**:
   - Client API: http://localhost:3000/api
   - Editor API: http://localhost:3001/api
   - Client UI: http://localhost:8080
   - Editor UI: http://localhost:8081

### Docker Commands

- **Build all services**: `docker compose build`
- **Start all services**: `docker compose up`
- **Start services in background**: `docker compose up -d`
- **Stop all services**: `docker compose down`
- **View logs**: `docker compose logs`
- **Restart services**: `docker compose restart`

### Individual Service Management

You can also run individual services:

```sh
# Run only the client API
docker compose up client-api

# Run only the client UI
docker compose up client-ui

# Run API services only
docker compose up client-api editor-api
```

### Service Architecture

The Docker setup includes four main services:

- **client-api**: NestJS API for client operations (port 3000)
- **editor-api**: NestJS API for editor operations (port 3001)
- **client-ui**: Static web application for clients (port 8080)
- **editor-ui**: Static web application for editors (port 8081)

### Troubleshooting

**Port conflicts**: If you get port binding errors, make sure no other services are running on ports 3000, 3001, 8080, or 8081.

**Build issues**: Make sure you've run the build command before Docker containerization:
```sh
npx nx run-many --target=build --all
```

**Dependencies issues**: If you encounter module not found errors, ensure npm install completed successfully before building.

## Generate a library

```sh
npx nx g @nx/js:lib packages/pkg1 --publishable --importPath=@my-org/pkg1
```

## Run tasks

To build the library use:

```sh
npx nx build pkg1
```

To run any task with Nx use:

```sh
npx nx <target> <project-name>
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

[More about running tasks in the docs &raquo;](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

## Versioning and releasing

To version and release the library use

```
npx nx release
```

Pass `--dry-run` to see what would happen without actually releasing the library.

## Keep TypeScript project references up to date

Nx automatically updates TypeScript [project references](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/project-references.html) in `tsconfig.json` files to ensure they remain accurate based on your project dependencies (`import` or `require` statements). This sync is automatically done when running tasks such as `build` or `typecheck`, which require updated references to function correctly.

To manually trigger the process to sync the project graph dependencies information to the TypeScript project references, run the following command:

```sh
npx nx sync
```

You can enforce that the TypeScript project references are always in the correct state when running in CI by adding a step to your CI job configuration that runs the following command:

```sh
npx nx sync:check
```

## Set up CI!

### Step 1

To connect to Nx Cloud, run the following command:

```sh
npx nx connect
```

Connecting to Nx Cloud ensures a [fast and scalable CI](https://nx.dev/ci/intro/why-nx-cloud?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) pipeline. It includes features such as:

- [Remote caching](https://nx.dev/ci/features/remote-cache?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/ci/features/distribute-task-execution?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Automated e2e test splitting](https://nx.dev/ci/features/split-e2e-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Task flakiness detection and rerunning](https://nx.dev/ci/features/flaky-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

### Step 2

Use the following command to configure a CI workflow for your workspace:

```sh
npx nx g ci-workflow
```
